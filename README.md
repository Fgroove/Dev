Hello world!

Fgroove here, I has learned C, and I am learning Ocaml, Verilog and Python.

In terms of names of programming languages, I prefer Ruby. Pity, I am still in the beginner level.

*In addition, I like Markdown.*

Now I'm a graduate student, still kinda confused about this major!

I was dedicated to distributed and parallel computing, and then I found interests there.
**BUT** I was assigned to security field! Almost everything starts from zero. Wow, I'm a newbie again. :)
